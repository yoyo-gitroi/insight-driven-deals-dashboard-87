        "Integration Objections Dominate Across Portfolio: Over 70% of deals report integration-related concerns, particularly with legacy systems, fragmented data sources, and demands for multi-cloud or API-based ingestion.",
        "Product Fit Concerns Reflect Diverse Industry and Scale Needs: Objections tied to product fit vary by sectorâ€”complex B2B/B2C mixes (HubSpot), small-mid market simplification demands (Amadeus, Chatham Bars Inn), and unique operational models (Cognizant services).",
        "Emerging Expansion Signals in Most Accounts: 6 out of 10 companies show clear upsell/expansion interest, often linked to multi-region rollout (TheGuarantors), organizational adoption plans (Amadeus), or feature growth (Billtrust).",
        "Confusion and Reporting Terminology Hinder Adoption: Multiple accounts (BigBasket, Billtrust, Helen of Troy) have recurring confusion about metric definitions, onboarding timelines, and analytics outputs, slowing momentum.",
        "Pricing and ROI Skepticism Constrains Deal Velocity Primarily in Mid-Market and Cost-Sensitive Segments (ecoATM, Chatham Bars Inn).",
        "Deal Velocity & Win Probability Vary by Account Complexity and Stakeholder Alignment: Velocity ranges from slightly slower (~-17% Skipify, BigBasket) to significantly faster (+20% Priceline). Win probabilities correlate with executive sponsorship and resolution of integration/product fit concerns.",

        "Legacy and Fragmented Tech Stacks Create Multi-Vendor Complexity: Customers rely on tools like Power BI, Snowflake, Salesforce, Domo, Kafka, internal ETLs, and bespoke platforms leading to integration friction and technical objections.",
        "Industry Vertical Nuances Shape Adoption Barriers: Hospitality customers emphasize budget and direct industry references; enterprise SaaS accounts focus on product fit with complex B2B/B2C models; IT services firms require cross-unit adoption and scalable insights.",
        "Competitive Pressure from Hyperscalers and Incumbents: Pilots with Google, People.ai, and internal tooling create competitive evaluation pressures, demanding clear differentiation in integration ease, automation, and actionability.",
        "Economic/Timing Constraints Influence Bandwidth: Year-end cycles, budget commitments, and resource limitations affect timeline adherence and require flexible, asynchronous engagement models."

      "Critical_Red_Flags": [
        "Unresolved Integration blockers in key technical accounts (BigBasket, Yatra) threaten timeline and adoption.",
        "ROI and pricing objections in cost-sensitive clients (ecoATM, Chatham Bars Inn) slow progression significantly.",
